About... 200 days ago I made one of the most important decisions of my life. I may not regret my decision, but I definitely regret all the avoidances I made, hopefully it's not too late.
Afterglow is a cup of boiled orange water, shallowly poured on the wind chimes in the window, the wind knocked over the glass of the sun, and the warm yellow fragrance spread all over the room. It seems that the intermittent separation in the past few years is nothing but the plot of the dream. But the plots in dreams and fantasies are slowly approaching me, approaching, approaching, and finally, they merged with me, and I finally chose to be the self in my dream. That's right, the self that only existed in imagination before... I never hid my tendencies, but... I was always intimidated by all kinds of side effects, and I didn't dare to take a step forward. I hated the withdrawn self... But until nothing There was no way to retreat, so I decided to move forward from now on. October 23, 2013 was a memorable day. I tried to take my first step...even if I retreated. But time will not wait for me... It will be 2022 in a blink of an eye, and I will be seventeen years old. I know very well that if I don't move forward, I will regret it for the rest of my life. I have to do everything as soon as possible... Otherwise, everything will become very difficult if I walk this road again.

Time, time, time, it's so important.

Sometimes I feel that the changes that happen to me are like a game of cultivation. EQ and mental age are cleared when we take this step, and slowly add up again. The forearm is becoming softer and softer, and the curves of the body are becoming more and more obvious.

Recently, the state of study is indeed quite poor. After all, I am locked in my small room of 20 square meters 24 hours a day, and I am still arguing with my parents... I can't study hard at all... and my mental state is getting worse and worse.

As my sister said, I seem to have become more naive. Looking back, I can always find that I seemed to have done stupid things a few days ago...and then regretted it...and my memory gradually blurred before the choice, it seems that in 2022 I only spent six months... 200 days... so my 2022 is only six months~

2023, I’m so nervous, a lot of things are a cliff that I can’t go wrong, study, family, money, independence, oh, I can’t breathe when I think about it… If I take a wrong step, maybe… I won’t necessarily die, although It is possible, but it will definitely be worse than death...

​My sister told me that out of her selfishness, she hoped that I could be happy every day...
I'm sorry, I didn't do this kind of thing, I'm not a competent little sister...
​…

Hey, so many people who are so important to me stay in 2022 forever... It seems to leave with them... Hey...
There are many more stars in the sky
But out of personal selfishness, I really don't want more people to leave me in that form...
