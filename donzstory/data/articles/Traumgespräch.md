I am deeply envious of everyone here because I have no talent. Unlike all of you—you who are talented, who have pursuits, who have dreams—I have no talent at all. In every way, I am inferior to others; I have no dreams. I merely pretend to be competent in certain areas, but a counterfeit is ultimately a counterfeit; it can never become the real thing. I may have told you that some people are fools, but that's because I believe you shouldn't waste your own talents and abilities. This is merely the envy and jealousy of a loser toward those who are capable. A capable person shouldn't abandon their own strengths; if you see them as a burden, isn't that too extravagant? You simply don't understand how empty life is without bearing any expectations!
