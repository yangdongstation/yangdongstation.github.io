**OutOfReach**  

So, you all are truly remarkable.  
Perhaps they are peaks I may never reach in my lifetime.  
As a mere "exam-taker," what qualifications do I have to be mentioned in the same breath as you?  
I can only sit daily at the bottom of my dim, damp, and deep well. Then, I look up at you shining stars in the sky.  
Those are the boundless seas and skies I yearn for in my heart but can never touch.  
Chairman Mao once said, "Our journey is to the stars and seas." But you are the dazzling stars on the horizon. As for me, someone like me, a creature of the dark and damp, can only sit at the bottom of the well. To reach even the edge of your brilliance, I'd need to cross the entire Milky Way.  
Yet, this is beyond my reach.

There's this image: you are the tip of the pyramid, while I am at the base. No matter how fiercely I compete, no matter how many ladders I raise to climb upward, I can only reach the edge of a cliff. One step forward, and I'd shatter into pieces.  
After a lifetime of striving, I realize that those who once shared a table with me are unattainable. Even after climbing countless mountains, crossing vast oceans, and exhausting myself in cutthroat competition, I still can't catch a glimpse of their shadows. As a child, I thought I could reach for the moon in the heavens. Now I know that even if I ascended to the heavens, I couldn't touch the moon's edge—only gaze in vain, mocking my own futile arrogance like a mayfly shaking a great tree.  
Your achievements make me look up in awe, unattainable as high mountains. My efforts are like the bird Jingwei trying to fill the sea—unless aided by immortals, they're doomed like Kuafu chasing the sun, destined to vanish in the crowd… My endeavors are like ants trying to shake trees… My "Yu Gong" (Foolish Old Man) efforts… Unless a Hercules assists, they'll be seen as the madness of a lunatic. All my toil is but futile, wasted labor.  
The achievements I pursue are but illusory reflections in water or flowers in a mirror. Like a drug-addled German Third Reich officer, who thinks he can stay awake for three days straight, feeling omnipotent—only a hallucination of morphine and heroin before the final flicker of life, a castle in the air.  
Like in *The Kite Runner*, after Hassan and Amir finished playing, Amir returned to his palace, while Hassan went back to his thatched hut—they were never of the same world. Tragically, I'm not even as fortunate as Hassan. I have no hut to return to, no safe harbor… So I envy everyone.  

Alright… I'll go make my futile efforts, to feel like I'm doing something real instead of chasing illusory dreams. Sometimes we numb ourselves—whether life is unsatisfying, days are too hard, or family traumas linger—using smoke, alcohol, dexmedetomidine, or pregabalin. It doesn't matter; what I do… is just like these things, a way to detach from reality, to stop feeling so unfulfilled.
